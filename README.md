Website Idea is a Virtual Closet 
Users can create outfits from their own closets to plan out what they want to wear. 
They can add links to each item to a website that sells the item. Users can also share their created outfits to others. 
On the home page will be the most recent item they have created, the most used item they have added to their outfits, and the most recently shared outfit.
In actual real life application, the photos would be a collage type like the one used in the shared outfit card that would be on top of a mannequin image. 
The top bar icons have home page, the outfit creation page, the items they have in their closet, the online stores they have saved, share button for items and outfits, and the current items that will be used in your current outfit creation. 
The Current Items button will dropdown to show what the user has added to their outfit creation.
